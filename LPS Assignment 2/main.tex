\section{Elections}

(a) $p\vee q$ : The election is decided or the votes have been counted.

(b) $\neg p \wedge q$ : The election is not decided and the votes have been counted.

(c) $\neg q\vee (\neg p \wedge q)$ : The votes have not been counted, or the election is not decided and the votes have been counted.

\section{Think and Drive}

(a) $p \wedge \neg q$

(b) $p \rightarrow q$

(c) $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$

\section{Arguments}

(a) The conclusion is that not eating meat is probably not a good idea. The conclusion seems false to me because there are many reasons to be a vegetarian and non-veg people also get Parkinson's. So saying that not eating meat is not a good idea doesn't seem justified.

(b) The conclusion can be related to fallacies. The conclusion is that you should play Powerball and it seems false to me because playing doesn't imply that you will win.
\section{Formulas}

Here is the truth table for $p\rightarrow q$.

\begin{tabular}{ll||l|l|l|l}
  $p$ & $q$ & $p \rightarrow q$ & $p \leftrightarrow q$ & $p \wedge \neg q$ & $ ((p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow p) \rightarrow p$\\
  \hline
  F & F & T & T & F & T\\
  F & T & T & F & F & T\\
  T & F & F & F & T & T\\
  T & T & T & T & F & T
\end{tabular}
\break
\begin{tabular}{ll||l|l}
  $p$ & $q$ & $(p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow (\neg q \rightarrow \neg p)$ & $(p\wedge(p \rightarrow q)) \wedge \neg p$\\
  \hline
  F & F & T & F\\
  F & T & T & F\\
  T & F & T & F\\
  T & T & T & F
\end{tabular} \break \break
a) and b) are neither tautology nor contradiction while c) and d) is a tautology and e) is a contradiction.
